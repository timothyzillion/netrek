In the early 1990s, I spent a lot of time playing netrek.

I played on some of the early INL teams.

I learned a lot about programming by playing, and by building cyborg players.

BSD-sockets, cryptographic signatures, network protocols -- netrek had a lot to offer (in the days of the pre-WWW internet).
