Changes as of 10/30/91.

New tools (cruftiness is high):

- mess.c.  This was given to me by Scott Silvey.  It can dump any multiline
  message from stdin or a file specified on the command line to any recipient.
  Not sure if it's distributable.

- pl3.c.  This tool tweaks ships in the game to achieve Top Gun effects.
  Used in conjunction with the "topgun" shell script.  Very ugly.

- stat.c.  A tool to show the status of wait queue every second.  Strangely
  enough it's not possible to determine the exact queue size.  Usually I go
  by ((wait == count) ? 0 : ans+1).

- topgun.  A shell script that takes the number of seconds of Top Gun desired
  as an argument.  Automatically shuffles the .sysdef files around (note: you
  need to create a .sysdef.topgun in the lib directory):

  TOURN=9
  SHIPS=SC,BB,DD,AS,CA,SB
  WEAPONS=PLASMA,TRACTOR
  PLKILLS=0
  SBRANK=0
  PLANETS=00,10,20,30
  CONFIRM=0
  HIDDEN=1
  MAXLOAD=100.0
  TOPGUN=1

- wander2.c, wander3.c.  External tools to move planets.  A version of
  wander2 was incorporated into my daemon.c.

- setgalaxy.c.  General purpose galaxy changing tool.
   usage:
   setgalaxy l              restore planet locations
   setgalaxy r              standard reset of galaxy
   setgalaxy t              tourney reset of galaxy - equal agris
   setgalaxy f              flatten all planets to 1 army
   setgalaxy F              top out all planets at 30 armies
   setgalaxy n <num>:<str>  rename planet <num> to <str>

Modified tools:

- players.c.  Has 3 modes instead of 2.
   players              gives rank/name/login/display/total ratings/DI
   players r            gives name/status*/type/bombing/planets/offense/defense
   players d            gives name/type/kills/damage/shields/armies/fuel

  *status = A/O/D/E for alive/outfitting/dead/exploding, followed by the
  ghostbust count, in ticks (if it reaches 3600, six minutes of inactivity,
  the slot is freed).

- watchmes.c.  If given any argument, runs in filter mode -- this is
  good for logging tourney action.  It will timestamp each message,
  and only display ones of a hardcoded "interest" level, as defined in
  struct.h:

  #define MGENO  0x100		/* order these by importance (0x100 - 0x400) */
  #define MCONQ  0x110
  #define MTAKE  0x120
  #define MDEST  0x130
  #define MKILLA 0x200          /* killed with armies */
  #define MBOMB  0x210
  #define MKILLP 0x220          /* killed by a planet */
  #define MKILL  0x230
  #define MLEAVE 0x300
  #define MJOIN  0x310
  #define MGHOST 0x320
  #define MCOUP1 0x330
  #define MCOUP2 0x340

- planets.c.  Displays surrender clock for debugging.

[ Bronco Netrek Release 2/20/92 ]

Changes as of 4/13/92.

  Makefile
  struct.h

- As was described in ntserv/CHANGES, if you use the FULL_HOSTNAMES
  compile option, you will have to recompile all of your tools with
  the flag on.

  xtkill.c

- Documentation was missing.  xtkill currently has the following usage:

    xtkill [0-9a-j] <mode><mode option>

    where <mode> is one of :
      e(ject from game)             (simulates self-destruct)
      s(hip class change)[abcdosA]  (A = ATT)
      t(eleport to quadrant)[frkoc] (c = center of galaxy)
      S(uper)                       (big shields/max damage/max etmp)
      T(eam change)[frko]           (no team == independent)
      D(emote)                      (-1 to rank)
      P(romote)                     (+1 to rank)
      F(ree slot)                   (bypasses 6 minute ghostbuster timeout)
      k(ills increment)             (+1 kill)
      h(arm)                        (no shields, 50% damage)
      a(rmies increment)            (+6 armies)
      C(lock, surrender -- set it)  (to 6 minutes (debugging aid))
      L(oss adjust, SB (-1))        (in case you toast an SB accidentally)
      R(obot obliterate)            (like obliterate, but only for robots)
      (no mode == obliterate)

  Xsg has most of these options and a better interface.  But being able
  to free a slot is useful when conducting a tourney -- in conjunction
  with "players r" which displays the ghostbust counts, and sometimes
  it is not convenient to set up an xhosted shell for xsg.

  planets.c

- Now displays core flags and planet (x,y) coordinates.

  scores.c

- The line that makes scores ignores players who are inactive for too long
  was commented out (inadvertently) in the previous release.  It has been
  put back in.

  setgalaxy.c

- On tourney resets, agri counts are no longer printed to stdout.
  That was primarily for debugging.

  stat.c

- Also shows status->tourn (generally not useful).

  watchmes.c

- Hardcoded "interest" level was lowered to include bombing messages.
  Helped to profile player activity during a tourney more accurately
  (see earlier watchmes entry for more info).

  New tool: loadchecker.c

- A background tool that reports CPU usage (0% to 99%) to ALL at
  regular intervals.  Works across daemon restarts (note -- a small
  daemon mod is required; daemon.c/freemem() should do a
  status->gameup = 0).  Not of much general interest -- it requires
  that /usr/ucb/vmstat exist and that vmstat's output match a certain
  pattern.  See source file for more details.

Changes as of 7/24/92:

  New tool: mergescores.c

- A tool that merges a foreign player database in the form of "scores
  A" output into a local server.  Read README.mergescores before use.

  xtkill.c

- Updated to reflect DD engine cooling rate (now 7, was 6).
