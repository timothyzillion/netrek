<Gerdesas> I must say I don't concur with some of these changes.  "Your
team has prohibited you beaming up" is not concise for new players;
there is no rhyme nor reason to parts of the code base that use
TRUE/FALSE and those that do not.  TRUE and FALSE make for more readable
code and on top of that there was no such review push for my original
work on this that added TRUE/FALSE to other files.  TRUE/FALSE
<Gerdesas> should be defined in in a top-level include, also.


List of things that are defects

        - etc/og/og should be populated on make install, see INSTALL.Newbie

	- on first entry to an INL=1 server,
	  INL->X0   You have been ejected due to player DB inconsistency.
	  but does not hinder player or game.

	- INL=1 incompatible with FPS=50, workaround is to set FPS=10.

	- robots are not recognising Cas, reported by KaraokeBar, Australia,
	  2007-05-15

	- Twarping to base docked on base can occasionally cause a
          glitch where both bases head warp 60 off the galaxy map.

	- Triple mode blanks planet names, if server vote to dogfight
	  or hockey, names are not restored.

	- With surrenderstart=1, occasionally see "The 0 0 20 minutes before
	  empire collapses" messages upon neuting a planet.

	- Sturgeon bug: problem with torp or plasma array in which a
          player may sometimes get to fire 9 torps, the 9th being in
          someone else's array (it's a different color torp).  On a
          related note, some people have reported losing the ability
          to fire torps, sometimes completely, sometimes in increments
          of 2, such as 6 or 4 or 2 [probably fixed - conquer ring plasma
          bug].

        - the email address to which INL statboys is sent to is defunct, and
          bouncing messages.

	- following change "Improved tracking of server modes" Wed Aug
          23 06:36:42 EST 2006 williamb@its.caltech.edu:
  
	  status->gameup synchronisation with forked robots includes
	  race conditions and unsafe process.  Robot sets flag once
	  started; it might not complete starting by the time an
	  attacker requests another vote.  If a robot terminates
	  unnaturally, the flag is left set, preventing server reset
	  or another vote.

	- cambot does not exit when daemon exits.

	- sending SIGSTOP to client for 35 seconds results in ghostbust, which
	  is good, but the client response after SIGCONT is not good ... it
	  presents team selection window and clicking on a team hangs the
	  client.

	- find causes of jammed slots and expire them sooner.

	- Player "^%^" took a planet and it said "Planet taken by ^"
	  reported by zu22 (Zach Uram) on 2006-04-05.  This is also
	  a client issue.

	- god observer should see all teams messages.

	- practice robots fail to shoot torpedoes if created while server 
          is in topgun mode.

	- make clean in ntserv doesn't.

	- configure's "checking for BSD style signals" doesn't finish
	  with a yes or a no.

	- quitting as captain in INL game should automatically uncaptain.

	- team masks are switched at the end of an INL game.  is
	  there any particular reason why we're doing this?

	- manually check dependencies in ntserv, an installer found
	  that a defs.h change was not picked up by at least one thing
	  therein, and so a make clean was required.

	- if installer changes config.h.in and then config.h manually,
	  running make causes configure to be re-run but without the
	  appropriate --prefix, thus building for the wrong place.

	- configure to set CONFIRM=1 if it finds res-rsa, and Makefile
	  to recommend the execution of updated at least once.

	- xsg Makefile (and others perhaps) compile
	  "../ntserv/getpath.c" saving the object file into the xsg
	  directory, and then promptly use the object files from the
	  ntserv directory, regardless of whether they are built yet.
	  Need to change it to either use the local copy (and thus waste
	  compile time), or nest into the ntserv Makefile.

	- switching into or out of no-geno timer hours on continuum resets quit
	  timeout, perhaps due to repeat of RSA verification.

	- jammed slots on other teams?  Can they be ejected?

	- practice robots drop shields as soon as you die, thus taking torps
	  in flight on hull.

	- change metaserver solicitation to process multiple IP addresses from
	  each DNS host name given, just like new COW metaserver code.
