	I want to thank the people of the server mailing list for all
there help with the code.

    Mark Levine     - 	For his work on the new getentry code.
    Kurt Siegl      -   For his work on Linux port, SYSV dependencies, and
			  the config.h format which eliminates much of the
			  ugliness of all the defines in the code. Oh, and
			  also for pointing out all the stupid things I do. :)
    Micheal Kantner -  For finding all the small things that I overlook while
			  looking at the big picture.
    Brian O'Neill   -  For his help in debugging the code and putting it to
			  the test at uml.
    Dave Gossilen   -  For starting this insane thing in the first place by
			  releasing Ver. 1. Also for the getpath.c and NTSERV
			  variable stuff.
