# Description:
# FEATURE_NAME: is a unique string of up to 80 characters describing
# a client or server feature.
# <S/C>: 'S' indicates that the feature requires server support.  Servers
# that do not support the feature, regardless of how it is listed in the
# .features file, will return value UNKNOWN to clients requesting that
# feature.  'C' indicates that the feature is a client option, requiring no
# special code support from the server.
# <ON/OFF>: As stated above, if the server does not support a given feature,
# this value is ignored and UNKNOWN will be sent to the client.  Otherwise
# this value is returned and will be honored by the client.
# [int-args]: two optional integer args may be used for future extensions.

#		feature.c and no one seems to want to fix it. So ALL the
#		features without confirm strings WILL NOT work. YOU WILL
#		HAVE TO PUT A CONFIRM ON THEM. To do this for example change:
#			Client Of Win: WHY_DEAD  	to
#			Client Of Win*confirm:0.00.0: WHY_DEAD
