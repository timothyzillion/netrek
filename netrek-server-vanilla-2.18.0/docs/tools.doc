I merged the bronco tools in with my own, and decided to add descriptions of
the bronco stuff to the tools doc.  Terence added some cool stuff to the
tools...

Hope this doesn't become too complicated and confusing.  Oh well.

Everything applies to the scam sources, except where noted with "**", which
are local enhancements.  Bronco enhancements are noted with "bronco:".


==============================================================================
	Commands
==============================================================================

makescores
----------
Usage: makescores

Sends "scores a" to "scorefile.a", "scores s" to "scorefile.s", and
"scores A" to "scoredb".  It then runs "trimscores" using "scoredb" as
input, and sends the output to "players.old" (which will get a brief
description of the players which were deleted).

message
-------
Usage: message

Allows you to send a message to any player.  You will be prompted for
a message (80 chars max) and a recipient (same characters 0-9a-jAFKRO as
in the game).  Note that it sends a "raw" message; you have to supply
the "GOD->R3" part yourself.

bronco: mess
------------
Usage: mess

Like message, only you can enter multi-line messages, which get sent in a
batch (so you don't have to keep running "message" over and over).  Also allows
multiple recipients (so you can send to "0123" instead of just "0").

newscores
---------
Usage: newscores < scoredb
(don't run while people are playing)

Regenerates the .player database.  "scoredb" should be the output of
"scores A".  The .player database is overwritten.  Note that the .player
database is updated by ntserv, and can get really screwed up if you change
it while the game is running (especially if you delete a player).

** nuke
-------
Usage: nuke
(don't run while the daemon is running)

Removes the shared memory segment.  Useful for when the daemon dies but
the segment is still there.  (Normally the daemon destroys the segment when
it quits, but if it crashes, the segment will remain.)

planets
-------
Usage: planets

List all planets with some general info about them.  Useful when you want
to see if the daemon generated a reasonable set of planets.

bronco: pl3
-----------
Usage: pl3 [seconds]

Sets "Top Gun" mode, where torps do 130 damage, plasmas are freely available,
and starbases can be brought out continually.  Automatically turns it off
when time expires.  Don't forget to configure the save file (default is
/usr/users/terence/xl/.sysdef.topgunrestore).  Note that CA has torpturns=2,
and BB/AS have torpturns=3.

players
-------
Usage: players [d]

List people playing the game.  The "d" flag will display kills, damage,
shields, armies, and fuel (currently a restricted mode).
** New "c" flag continuously checks the game for players, and reports a
count.  Useful if you're waiting for people to sign on.

bronco: new 'r' flag shows ratings and status (ghostbust slot) stuff.  The
status codes are Free, Outfit, Alive, Exploding, and Dead.

resetplanets
------------
Usage: resetplanets
(don't run while people are playing... it will work though)

Resets galaxy to default setup, with 30 armies per planet and original
owners.

bronco: setgalaxy
-----------------
Usage: setgalaxy [l|r|t|f|F|n]

Replacement for resetplanets.  Allows you to reset just locations, just
armies, rename planets, etc.  Run with no args for usage info.

scores
------
Usage: scores [aodbprstgAOD]
a - print best players in order
o - list players with best offense
d - list players with best defense
p - list players with best planet rating
b - list players with best bombing rating
s - list best starbase players
D - list players with DI ratings
[ for the above, players with <1 hour or >4 weeks of non-play are omitted ]
r - list all players, hours, and ratings
t - print rough number of seconds of play time
g - print stats for all players, with breakdown by non-tournament, tournament,
    and starbase
A - list entire database in ASCII form (for use with newscores)
O - print players who haven't logged in for 4 weeks

bronco: new 't' option - list players with best total ratings.  The old 't'
option has been moved to 'T'.

The format for "scores A" is:
(top line: total time, planets, bombing, kills, losses, timeprod?)
name		password	keymap........................................
..............................................rank nt-maxkills  nt-kills
nt-losses nt-armies nt-planets nt-ticks t-kills t-losses t-armies t-planets
t-ticks sb-kills sb-losses sb-ticks sb-maxkills lastlogin flags

The spacing may be important (especially the first few fields; if you change
a name, make sure the password lines up correctly).

** See also the "pledit" utility, available via anonymous FTP.

showgalaxy
----------
Usage: showgalaxy [-d##]

A curses-based tool to watch the galaxy.  The -d option allows you to set
the number of frames per update (default is 10 == 1 update/second).
** default is now 5 (2 updates/second)

Commands are:
f - full screen view (use this to un-zoom or un-whatever)
m - send message (press a key for destination (AFKRO0-9abcdef), then type
    message.  ESC exits this mode without sending anything.)
z - zoom in (follow with player number)
P - show list of planets
L - show list of players (hit space bar to toggle info screen)
^L- redraw (there seems to be some VT-100 specific stuff here)
. - ** panic button (clears the screen, waits for keypress)

** See also the "xsg" command, available via anonymous FTP.

bronco:stat
-----------
Usage: stat

Displays some stuff from the "status" struct.  Don't worry about it.

[trimscores description ... deleted, out of date, June 2002, quozl]

bronco: wander
--------------
Usage: wander

Apparently incomplete attempt to make the core planets circle the home world.
Try "wander -R" for Romulans, etc.  You can specify a movement increment
with "-i".  The "-d" flag mentioned in the usage string doesn't seem to be
handled.  There are three of these, wander.c, wander2.c, wander3.c; if you
feel like playing around with them, go ahead, but you're on your own...

watchmes
--------
Usage: watchmes

Continually display all messages sent in the game.

bronco: supplying an argument (anything) causes certain messages to be
filtered out.  This makes it more suitable for logging (note that "tee"
and "tail -f" won't work because of output buffering; just use two watchmes
processes or a utility like showgalaxy or xsg which displays messages if
you want to see them and log them at the same time).

xtkill
------
Usage: xtkill player

"Utterly obliterates" a player by "divine mercy."  Player is not kicked out
of the game, just nuked in a big way (the starbase explosion is used).  Note
that "player" is a NUMBER; currently a-f is not supported (it uses atoi()).

bronco: lots of new options.
Usage: xtkill {0-9a-j} [mode[mode option]]
    e - eject (original xtkill purpose; the default if no mode is specified)
    s - ship class [abcdosA] (change to new type of ship)
    t - teleport [frkoc] (race or center)
    S - Super (lots of shields & damage)
    T - Team [frko] (change which team the player is on)
    D - Demote (drop one step in rank)
    P - Promote (bump up one step in rank)
    F - Free slot (free up a ghostbusted slot - no player but still blocked)
    k - kills increment (give them free kills)
    h - harm (remove shields and make them 50% damaged)
    C - Coup?  Sets the surrender timer to a low value (6)

Keep in mind that the ship changes use an internal version of "getship.c"
which may or may not match your own.  The ship change also appears to grant
plasmas.


Note that programs like "watchmes" and "showgalaxy" may become confused if
the daemon exits (usually because nobody has been playing for 60 seconds).
It is usually necessary to restart the program.
** UTS showgalaxy now watches for the daemon to die and come back, so you can
leave it running between sessions.


==============================================================================
	Dot Files
==============================================================================

.access
-------
Controls access from specific machines.  People who are denied access will
simply be dropped.  A sample file might look like:

default         y
amdahl          n

.conquer
--------
Whenever a team genocides another team or conquers the entire galaxy, a report
is appended to this file.

.global
-------
Raw data file; contains global statistics for tournament mode usage.  Don't
modify.  The data stored here represents the TOTAL #of ticks of play, the
total #of armies bombed, etc, etc; it's used for determining ratings (and
therefore DI).

.motd
-----
This is the message displayed when you sign on (news & instructions).  Each
screenful is 28 lines long; I use line 28, 56, etc as a "next page is..."
line.

.planets
--------
This keeps info on planets between games.  Stores the current #of armies,
current owner, whether a planet has fuel/repair/agri, etc.  If you truncate
the file, a new set of planets will be generated the next time the daemon
is started.  If you remove the file, a new set of planets will be generated
EVERY TIME the daemon is started (daemon only updates the file; it doesn't
create it).

If the game is running but you want to have it re-shuffle at a later date,
remove the old file and touch a new one.  Truncating the existing file won't
work, since the daemon has it open and will re-write the info before it exits.

.players
--------
The actual player database.  Raw data; access with the "scores" command.

.sysdef
-------
System definition constants; allows you to change various features.  This is
the most interesting of the dot files...

A typical file looks like:
TOURN=4
SHIPS=SC,BB,DD,AS,CA,SB
WEAPONS=PLASMA,TRACTOR
PLKILLS=2
SBRANK=3
PLANETS=00,10,20,30
CONFIRM=1
HIDDEN=1
MAXLOAD=100.0
CHAOS=0
UDP=1

TOURN is the #of players required per side for tournament mode.  The default
is five.  Changing it to nine effectively disables tournament mode.

SHIPS is the allowable ship classes.
** Add GA for Galaxy class ships, and ?? for ATT ships.

WEAPONS specifies special weapons.  Currently PLASMA and TRACTOR are allowed.
** Now SCANNER allows scanning beams.

PLKILLS is the #of kills required before you can refit for plasma torps.

SBRANK is the minimum rank required to drive a starbase.  Ensign is 0.

PLANETS specifies a list of possible starting planets.  Every time someone
enters the game, a planet in their space is chosen at random from the list.
If there aren't any listed, their home planet will be used.  This implies
two things: it is possible to have more than one start planet, but it is
impossible to start in foreign space.

CONFIRM is a boolean flag; if 1, then the server will attempt to verify
that the client is not modified (see "reserved.c").
** If 2, then cyborg clients can pass the word "Cyborg" for the verify
packet and be accepted.

HIDDEN is a boolean flag.  If 0, hidden mode is turned off (you can see
all players on the galactic map).  If 1, it's activated for tournaments.
** If 2, it's always active.

MAXLOAD is the maximum load average allowed before the game shuts itself down.
** Under UTS, if MAXLOAD is set to "0.0", then the game will shut down.  No
comparison with the actual load average is performed.

CHAOS is a boolean flag; if TRUE, then "chaos mode" is turned on.  This has
the following effects:
- you can join any team at any time, without having to quit.  Self destruction
  does not force you out.
- the only restriction on who can have a starbase is rank (you can have as
  many as you want, you don't need 4 planets, no time delay, can be alone).
- starbases move at warp 3, and don't have problems with weapon temperature.

** UDP sets UDP mode.  0 turns it off, 1 turns it on, 2 enables connect-message
debugging, 3 enables verbose debugging.

Note that these changes can be made while the game is being played.  So, you
can switch to CHAOS mode and drop SBRANK, become a starbase, and change it
back before anybody else can do anything.  The game DOES print the message
"The rules of the game have changed", so that people will be aware that
something is different.
