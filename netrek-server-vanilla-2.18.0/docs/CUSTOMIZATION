	Here is a more in-depth explanation into some of the features
that can change the server.

1) config/config.h defines :

	AUTOMOTD - Use this if you're not going to run the update daemon.
		This will check you .motd and rebuild it every once in a
		while. Don't use both AUTOMOTD and the update daemon.

	CHAIN_REACTION - This will not give credit for chain-reaction and
		will also report how a player died.

	ERIKPLAGUE - Eric Mehlhaff's planet plague code that was used for
		SINL 93.

	NEED_EXIT - Some systems need exit to be defined in socket.c

	RSA - Use RSA verification.  RSA is now deprecated.

	SHOW_RSA - Display some messages like failed RSA verification message
		and type of client on entry of player.

	RESETGALAXY - Every time a conquer occurs reset the galaxy.

	SHORT_THRESHOLD - More support for Short packets.  Causes the
		update rate to halve under certain conditions.  With
		modern networks, we do not need or want this, and we
		have never seen it trigger anyways.  Save some CPU
		cycles by defaulting it to off.

	SURRENDER_SHORT - Cut the surrender time in half when the genocide
		counter starts.

	SPEEDUP - Some misc. improvements to make the daemon faster.

	TWO_RACE - Conquer only a 1/4 of the galaxy for the galaxy to reset.

	SENDFLAGS - Print flags used in the compile on the MOTD.

	CHECK_ENV - Check the environment variable NTSERV_PATH for the
		location of system files.

	GPPRINT - Print the path that is being used to find the system files.

	NEWMASK - Use a newer tournament mask function that is less rigid
		than older version. Doesn't take preferences into account.

	FLAT_BONUS - 5x bonus for killing last army on a planet

	BASEPRACTICE - Base training server. (Need special robots, see
		README.basep).

	NEW_CREDIT - give 1 planet for destroying, two planets for taking.

	SBFUEL_FIX - fix starbase re-fueling

	NEW_ETEMP - Wreck's etemp fix

	DOGFIGHT - .sysdef interface for dogfight robot

	VOTING - allow voting mode

        ALLOW_EJECT     - define to allow players to eject others (only when
			  VOTING is defined).

        NO_BRUTALITY    - disallow fighting between waiting players in the
			  dogfighting mode (only when DOGFIGHT is defined).

	ROBOT_OBSERVER_OFFSET	- define to ensure that the moderation robot
			  is always in slot g.

	SB_RAPID_COOLDOWN	- allows for twice the normal rate of weapon
				  cool down; useful on base-practice.

	ALLOW_PRACTICE_ROBOT_SB	- allows practice robots to be refit into
				  starbases if defined.

	CHRISTMAS	- replace pre-t bot names; Kathy becomes Santa and the
			  other bots are replaced with the names of the 9
			  reindeer.

		t-mode galaxy is eligible to be restored when t-mode starts
		again.

	PRET_SAVE_ARMIES - (0 or 1) If set armies carried by players at the
		start of Pre-T will get returned to the players home planet.
		This will occur just prior to the galaxy being saved if
		PRET_SAVE_GALAXY is enabled.

	NEWTURN - (0 or 1) Different turning speeds.

	HIDDEN - (0 or 1) Enemy players that are far away from a friendly ship
		during t-mode will be hidden.

	MAXLOAD - (0 or 1) The maximum load allowed on the server's machine.

	PLANETS - (0 - 39) The planets the will be the home planets. There are
		4 params here. The order is fed, rom, kli, and then ori.

	RECREATIONAL_DOGFIGHT_MODE - (0 or 1) If 1 pl_reset() will generate
		a galaxy where each planet is INDI owned, FUEL/REPAIR with
		no armies and that is known by all teams.  This is used for
		servers whose intent is to provide a location for dogfight
		practice without interference from any bots that may be present.
		NOTE: for such a server seting TOURN=99 is also recommended
		to prevent t-mode from starting.
		NOTE: it may be necessary to run "tools/setgalaxy d" to force
		a galaxy reset if a normal galaxy currently exists.

	PLANET_PLAGUE
		Simulates the effects of plague on a planet's army
		count; the more armies on a planet and the higher the
		chances are that some will "die off" due to plague.
		Plague can never cause a planet to fall below 4 armies
		and that the chances of a planet at 5 armies being
		plagued is extremely small.

	Dog-Fighter Specific Defines:
		CONTESTSIZE - ( >0) Number of the contestants needed
				    before starting.

		NUMMATCH - ( >0) Number of matches per contest.

		SAVE_DOG_STAT - (0 or 1) Save the player stats?
				(not implemented yet..).

	In addition ship characteristics can be changed. The list of
	characteristics that can be changed are:
          TURNS, ACCS, TORPDAMAGE, PHASERDAMAGE, PHASERFUSE, PLASMADAMAGE,
          TORPSPEED, TORPFUSE, TORPTURNS, PLASMASPEED, PLASMAFUSE, PLAMSATURNS,
          MAXSPEED, REPAIR, MAXFUEL, TORPCOST, PLASMACOST, PHASERCOST,
          DETCOST, WARPCOST, CLOAKCOST, RECHARGE, ACCINT, DECINT, MAXSHIELD,
          MAXDAMAGE, MAXEGNTEMP, MAXWPNTEMP, EGNCOOLRATE, WPNCOOLRATE,
          MAXARMIES, WIDTH, HEIGHT, TYPE, MASS, TRACTSTR, TRACTRNG.

	  To set ship characteristics you need to do something like the
	  following:

		SHIP=1
		BB PHASERCOST 945
		AS TORPCOST 210
		!       MaxWpnTemp should ONLY be defined when non-chaos mode.
		SB MAXWPNTEMP 1500
		END

	  Unless SHIP is 1 the stats between SHIP and END will not be read in.
	  This example sets the NEWSHIP defines found at some servers. A '!'
	  is a comment.

3) .time file.

	The time file is an array field that is 7 by 24. Each line is for the
	days of the week and each character in the line is for the hours.
	Line 0 is Sun. Line 6 is Sat. Char. 0 is 12am and char 23 is 11pm.

	Allowable characters are:

		X - Non-playable hours. The server is down.

		C - Clue hour. The server is up and checking for clue.

		Anything else is interpreted as playable.

4) .features file.

	The .features file specifies the features specific to a client that
	are allowed at a server. There are two formats for a line in the
	features file. The client type is gotten from the RSA client type
	field.

		1) <Client Type>: <Features>
		   EX:
			BerkRick Moo: SMARTMACRO NEWMACRO

		   This method doesn't check for the version of the client.
		   It is assumed that every version of this client will have
		   these features.

		2) <Client Type>*confirm:<Version>: <Features>
		   EX:
			BerkRick Moo*confirm:2.00.15: WHY_DEAD

		   This method checks the version sent by the client to see if
		   the client is new enough to have this feature. The client
		   has to have a version >= to the version specified to have
		   the server send the message to the client. The Version field
		   in is in the format of: Version:PatchLevel.

5) .banned file, clue-bypass file.

	These both use a similar format. The .banned file lists players that are
	banned from the server. The .clue-bypass lists players that don't need
	to go through clue checking.

	Each line in these files should follow the format:

		<login>@<domain>
	The domain field can contain the total domain such as
	guzzler.ecst.csuchico.edu or can contain "*"s for all names such as
	*.ecst.csuchico.edu would include all machines in the .ecst.csuchico.edu
	domain.

Under Solaris 2.5.1 the wildcard "*" does not work. If wish to ban
all login attempts from rpi.edu, I must have something like this in my
.banned file:

leemy@rpi.edu

If I do a leemy@*.rpi.edu the ban does not work. If the "*" wildcard
method does not work try this way.

6) Robot configuration

	The newbie and pre-t robots accept commands from players by
	default.  To prevent potential abuse this feature may be
	deactivated by editing robotd/defs.h and changing the line:

	#undef BOTS_IGNORE_COMMANDS

	to

	#define BOTS_IGNORE_COMMANDS

	This change will require the bots to be re-compiled and
	reinstalled.
