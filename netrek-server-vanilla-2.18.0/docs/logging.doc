   -DCHECKMESG enables checks for message logging
   In defs.h, 

   #define MESGLOG	"mesg.LOG"	for logall
   #define GODLOG	"god.LOG"	for loggod

CONFIG OPTIONS

   logall=<1/0>			log all player generated messages
   loggod=<1/0>			log messages to GOD, or preceded by GOD:

DESCRIPTION
   
   If logall is set, all messages sent by players are logged.
   This option must be set before the daemon is started.  The daemon
   starts a separate program ('logmes') if this option is given.

   If loggod is set, only messages preceded by "GOD:" ("god:") are logged.

   The log files store each message in the following format:

   <date> <player number>(<player login address>) <message>
