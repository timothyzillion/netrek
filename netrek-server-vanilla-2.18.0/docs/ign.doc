Ignoring Messages
-----------------
Any player can now ignore any other player.  There are three types of
messages, which can be called "All", "Team", and "Indiv".

To toggle "ignore" status for a player, send that player a message of the
form

:[a][t][i]

E.g.:

 K0->R1 :i       to ignore messages of the form R1->K0
 K0->R1 :a       to ignore messages of the form R1->ALL
 K0->R1 :t       to ignore messages of the form R1->KLI
 K0->R1 :ita     to toggle everything
 K0->R1 :        to see the current "ignore" status

That player will not receive the message.  Instead you will receive a 
message telling you what the "ignore" status for that player has been 
change to.  When that player quits you will stop ignoring that slot.
