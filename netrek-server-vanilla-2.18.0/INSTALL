Instructions for installing the Vanilla Netrek Server

Summary
-------

	0)  decide where to install the server on your file system,
	1)  type "./configure --prefix=path" replacing path with your choice,
            (default path is /usr/local/games/netrek)
	2)  type "make install",
	3)  "cd" to the path you gave, or /usr/local/games/netrek,
	4)  "bin/netrekd" to start the server,
	5)  use a client to connect to the server.

Details
-------

Refer to INSTALL.RSA if you want your server to authenticate clients.

Edit the file config.h.in to meet your requirements.  You may choose to
leave this as is for a pure Vanilla default server.

To setup the server to your machine's architecture run the configure program. 
This is a script that will check your system for system dependent differences
and configure the server to deal with these.  It will accept an alternate path
to the directory into which the server is to be installed.  This is called
LIBDIR and defaults to /usr/local/games/netrek

In some cases it has been reported that the configure script is unable to
locate the GNU DBM library and development headers.  This is normally the
case when the library and headers are installed in a non-standard location.
To resolve this you must pass an additional set of arguments to the configure
script; these arguments are specified as:

CFLAGS=-I/path/to/gdbm/headers LDFLAGS=/path/to/gdbm/libs ./configure

as always you can specify "--prefix=/path/to/install/to" or any other
configure arguments to the end of the above line.

Configure will make two files for the server to deal with the differences. 
These are config.h and system.mk.  

(If you intend to do any development work, consider typing at this stage "make
depend".  This will add file dependencies to the Makefiles to optimize
recompilation.  However, please "make rmdependencies" before submitting patches
or changes back to CVS.)

Now you're ready to make the server.  Type "make" in the source root
directory.

If everything is made okay then type "make install" to move the files to the
installation directory.

Once everything is compiled and installed you may wish to edit the server
configuration files for your requirements.  Here are some of the files and what
they do:

	sysdef 		- tunable parameters
	ports		- specifies ports used to connect to this server
	time		- playable/clue hours in it
	banned		- list of players that are banned from server
	bypass		- list of players that are allowed on an RSA server
			  if playing with a non-RSA client.
	clue-bypass	- list of players that don't have to go through
			  clue checking
	conquer		- server's conquest stats output
	features	- list of special features allowed at the server
			  that some clients might have. Some of these
			  features may be considered 'borgish'
	motd		- this is the information about the server for the
			  players
	motd_clue	- another motd for clue playing hours
	reserved	- RSA public/global key listing for verification

Normally, these files are located in the "etc" sub-directory of the
directory you installed the server into.  But you can also configure
the source with --sysconfdir to place them somewhere else.

If the install worked then go to the installation directory. There are two
programs that should be running all the time.  They are:

    1.  netrekd - waits around for a connection from a client. It then forks
	and execs an ntserv.  This also accepts connections from the metaserver
	and via telnet for the current player list.

    2.	update - wakes up once a day and gets a new key list from the
	metaserver port 3530.  It then makes a new .reserved through
	rsa_keycomp and reconstructs your .motd file.  [Note that this program
	need not run if you are behind a firewall or if you are not using RSA].

Start these two programs.  Once they are running then try connecting to the
server and check things out.  If there is a problem then check out the
docs/DEBUG.HELP file for possible solutions.

See docs/metaservers-HowTo for soliciting players via the metaservers.

Running two servers on one host, same binaries
----------------------------------------------

1.  build the server as usual, to the point of "make install",

2.  duplicate the etc/ and var/ tree, once per virtual server,

	cd /usr/local/games/netrek
	cp -pr etc etc.inl
	cp -pr var var.inl

3.  configure each etc tree to use separate IP addresses or port numbers,

4.  start each server with a unique PKEY and SYSCONFDIR,

	PKEY=128 netrekd
	SYSCONFDIR=/usr/local/games/netrek/etc.inl \
	LOCALSTATEDIR=/usr/local/games/netrek/var.inl \
	PKEY=129 netrekd

	
Running two servers on one host, different binaries
---------------------------------------------------

1.  obtain another copy of the source tree,

2.  re-run configure using different install paths, for example:

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/games/netrek-inl

3.  edit include/defs.h and change the default PKEY to a different
    value, so the servers operate in different shared memory segments.

4.  edit docs/sample_ports file to use different ports or IP addresses
    than the original server, (this becomes etc/ports),

5.  change PORT in the robots/*defs.h files to match docs/sample_ports,

6.  compile and install, for example:

	make
	make install

7.  start, for example:

	cd /usr/local/games/netrek-inl
	bin/netrekd
