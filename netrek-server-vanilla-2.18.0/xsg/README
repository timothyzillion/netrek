WHAT IS XSHOWGALAXY?

 This is essentially an X version of the "showgalaxy" utility which comes with
 netrek.  It can only be used by Netrek (Xtrek II) server operators, because
 it accesses the Netrek shared memory segment directly.

INSTALLATION

 1) There is no struct.h or defs.h included with the distribution.  Instead 
    you are expected to make a symbolic link to struct.h and defs.h in your
    particular server distribution. i.e: 'ln -s ../ntserv/struct.h' if the 
    ntserv code is located one directory over.  

    NOTE: Don't forget to add any special preprocesser symbols used in your 
    server Makefile to DEFINES in the xsg Imakefile.  If your distribution
    is similar to the INL server, you might be able to make use of
    Makefile.INL.

 2) Check and/or update the defaults for these defines in xsg_defs.h:  

   NICE	 	-- for recording, the program name that sets lower priority 
		   on compression process.
   COMPRESS	-- compress program (if you have gzip -f, it is recommended)
   UNCOMPRESS	-- location of uncompress ("" gunzip -f "")

 3) Edit Makefile, changing these symbols if needed

   CC			-- C compiler
   CDEBUGFLAGS		-- debug flags
   EXTRA_LIBRARIES	-- any extra libraries given
   DEFINES  		-- any special definitions

   If the struct.h you linked in step 1 requires special preprocesser 
   symbols, add them to DEFINES.

 4) xmkmf ; make depend ; make

   (If you have any problems with the Imakefile, try using Makefile.INL)
