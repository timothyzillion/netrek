WHAT IS XSHOWGALAXY?
--------------------

 This is an X version of the "showgalaxy" utility which comes with netrek.  
 It can only be used by Netrek (Xtrek II) server operators, because it accesses 
 the Netrek shared memory segment directly.

 It has a vast number of improvements over the original "showgalaxy", including
 graphics display, the ability to modify ships or planets, and game-record or
 game-playback functionality.  

FEATURES
--------

    - galactic and tactical displays on same screen
    - more detail, since it's X instead of curses
    - ability to lock onto a player or planet
    - ability to move around the game board as if you were playing (at up to
      warp 40 though)
    - ability to change player status, including:
      - player name (reset when they get killed)
      - team (F/R/K/O/I)
      - ship type (yes, instant refit on the fly, with shield/damage/fuel
	scaled proportionately; robots will retain any special abilities, like
	free torpedos and phasers)
      - shield/damage/fuel; options are heal (cure all, including wtemp/etemp),
	help (cure 10%), harm (damage 10%), hose (damage fully - barely
	alive), and cool weapons (for SBs).
      - number of kills (+/- 1)
      - toggle shield status (kinda fun if timed correctly)
      - knock out of orbit
      - pacify (clear hostile and war)
    - ability to nuke (as with xtkill) or eject (forced self-destruct)
    - ability to modify planets, including:
      - planet name
      - ownership
      - special features (fuel/repair/agri)
      - number of armies (+/- 5, or Destroy)
    - ability to move players and planets to an arbitrary location (this does
      tend to freak people out though)
    - visible tractor/pressor beams
    - continuously updated player/planet display
    - larger "all messages" display, with optional message beep when a
      message sent to GOD is received
    - mouse warp to message window
    - the ability to send counterfeit messages.
    - some of the Options from Netrek, including update frequency, choice of
      planet bitmaps, view kill messages, show tactical planet names,
      and show shields
    - most of the items in the Options menu can be set in $HOME/.xsgrc
      (including updates/second, show shields, what to show on the galactic
      map, and whether or not to display xsg's "position")
    - the ability to show torps and phasers on the galactic map as well as 
      local display.
    - army counts displayed next to each planet on the galactic map.
    - standard netrek Info dialogs (both 'i' and 'I')
    - optional support for Galaxy and AT&T ships and Iggy bitmaps
    - ability to start server robots via robot-option menu ('R')
    - the ability to save and replay games (see below)

 It also has everything that showgalaxy had, including the ability to send
 messages to players.

 While you shouldn't be mucking around with people while they're playing a
 serious game, it can prove invaluable when you want to test certain features
 (you can damage robots, switch to an SB without having to play with .sysdef,
 try fighting an SB Guardian, etc, etc.)  It's also possible to completely
 re-sculpt the galaxy; you can rearrange all the planets, rename them, reassign
 them fuel/repair/agri at will, etc.  Sort of a Netrek Galaxy Editor really.

 there is
   
   godsname:				default "GOD", change to anything
					you like short of 32 characters.

   msgbeep:	[on,off]		beep on message to god
   showposn:	[on,off]		show xsg cursor on current position
   mapfire:	[on,off]		show torps & phasers on galactic map.
   updatespeed:	[0-3]			0 - 5 updates/sec
					1 - 4 updates/sec
					2 - 2 updates/sec
					3 - 1 updates/sec
   recordfile:  [file or directory name]

 See "sample.xsgrc" in this directory for more details.

PLAYBACK FEATURES	(Bharat.Mediratta@Eng.Sun.Com)
-----------------

        Replay uses On The Fly Decompression (TM).  Therefore, 
 do NOT try to uncompress the game file (called something like 'xsg.rf.ddd.Z' 
 unless overridden with 'recordfile' in the xsgrc file.)  The recorder gets 
 about 90% compression so a 1 hour game amounts to about 11Mb...compressed.  
 Uncompress that and you're looking at a) a file that replay won't be able to
 read anymore and b) a 110Mb file.

	To play back a file, and thus enter xsg's replay-mode, you must 
 pass it the filename on the command line:

                xsg -f <file[.Z]>

 The commands specific to the replay functionality of xsg are very simple.

        f.......................Play the game forward
        b.......................Play the game backward
        <space>.................Toggle single-step mode
        +.......................Speed up the game
        -.......................Slow down the game
        t.......................Skip until t-mode
	X.......................Begin/end extraction

 All other commands work except for those that modify ships or players
 (obviously).


XSG2.0 KNOWN BUGS/GLITCHES:
---------------------------

- When you change ship types, the shield/damage/fuel status bars are re-scaled,
  but they aren't erased before they're redrawn.  This can leave a splotch on
  the status display.  (Note this can also happen normally in the game if you
  refit while partially damaged.)

- Moving planets around causes the galactic map to get smeared (in the clients
  only; xsg redraws the screen automatically).  Refreshing the screen should
  remove the smear.

- You can't move a player who is orbiting a planet.  On the other hand, if
  you move a planet, all orbiting players move with it.  The "knock out of
  orbit" item on the "modify player" menu should be used to move an orbiting
  player.

- Netrek uses a 40x40 grid to determine which planets need to be redrawn on
  the galactic map.  If you put them too close together, the higher-numbered
  planet may become erased from the galactic map when somebody flies over it.

- Name changes to planets don't propagate to clients.  Only people who log in
  after the change is made will see it.

- The playerlist will show old data or possibly garbage as players are
  entering.  This is best fixed by fixing grabslot() in ntserv/enter.c
  to put "-" into p_name, p_login, and p_mapchars (two different places in
  the routine).

- There are conflicting definitions for Galaxy class cruisers (even the most
  "current" definition of the sources I grabbed had different #of max armies
  in netrek/getship.c and ntserv/getship.c).  When you change a ship type, xsg
  will use whatever numbers are compiled into it.  If you have a different or
  modified getship.c, you'll have to substitute it in.  You may also have to
  substitute sysdefaults.c if your ship defs depend on "chaos" mode or some
  other feature.

  (While it's not true in all cases, you should be able to simply copy your
  getship.c over the xsg copy.  If you want to use your sysdefaults.c, you
  may need to add some definitions to data.h and data.c.)
