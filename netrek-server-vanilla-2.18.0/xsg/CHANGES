v2.1
- Added support for INL POBSERV (observers).  
 	Observers don't show up on the display since they would only obscure
	planets and "legitimate" players.  However, you can lock on an observer
	(or any player) by selecting their entry in the player list.  Messages
	can also be sent to observers now.
- Added SHORT-PACKETS fix to pmessage2()
- xsg now uses an Imakefile (not to worry, if you have X, you have xmkmf).
- Added Makefile.INL for a version that will compile transparently with the INL 
  server (will be available with the INL server distribution).

UPDATE/CHANGES by Bharat Mediratta (bharat@shadow.eng.sun.com)

BUGS FIXED
- Added more SYSV support everywhere.
	I removed dependancies on the BSD libraries by macro-defining
	bcopy(), bzero(), etc to be the SYSV compliments, ie memmove(),
	memset(), etc.
	SysV support is still not entirely solid.  I occasionally get
	read() errors which crash xsg.
- Made code more ANSI compliant
	Changed all the 'static char' lines for bitmap definitions to
	the more appropriate 'static unsigned char' to prevent ANSI
	compilers from barfing.

FEATURES
- Added facility to extract segments of the game
	This is solid with -DSHRINKFRAME, but for some reason is
	flaky without it.  Hit X to start extracting and X again to
	stop.
	Modified XSG.doc to reflect this new command.
- Added option to view game at 10ud/s
	Not only is it nifty, it lets you skim over boring parts of the
	game.  Since this might not work on all machines, it's #ifdef'd
	with the -DREALLYFAST macro.
- Turning on FF mode no longer turns off BACKWARD and SINGLE_STEP
	It wasn't very intuitive.  Sure it's rare that the user would
	seriously want to use FF with BACKWARD or SINGLE_STEP, but 
	it's confusing if they're turned off without the user knowing
	about it.
	FF no longer overrides SINGLE_STEP, either.  Now you can SINGLE_STEP
	frame-skip frames at a time, if you really want to.
- Replaced the clock with a frame counter when in playback mode.
	It's more useful when replaying a game to be able to say "skip to
	frame 3175 and watch Spaceace! doosh the base!"
	I had to extend itoa() a bit in order to get 6-digit numbers to work.
- Added a real playback status line that tells you exactly what you're doing.
	The new status line will say things like:
		FORWARD
		SINGLE-STEP REWIND
		FAST-FORWARD
	and the like, which is easier for clueless twinks to understand.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
- Extract is not entirely solid without SHRINKFRAME defined.
- Still crashes occasionally under SYSV

v2.01pl2
- changed messages to have from set to 255 instead of 19 (Ij) since most
  clients ignore MGOD.
- Added Sheldon's TrueColor patch to x11window.c

v2.01pl1
- took out abort() debug in W_CacheLine.  
- added fast forward ('F') for playback along with a defaults variable
  'frameskip' to set how many frames to skip each time (default 20).
- added patchlevel.h, version.h, Manifest

v2.01
BUGS FIXED
- removed string-constant writes in defaults.c.  Was causing segv when 
  compiled with gcc.
- zero'd the frame initialization during playback.
- added better checking in dmessage.c for bad messages
- added setvbuf and newer libraries in Makefile for SYSV (from Nick Trown).
- simpler GALAXY/ATT/IGGY scheme -- no Makefile symbols, detects if 
  GALAXY and/or ATT defined.  All bitmaps defined.
- various fixes by James Hawtin

FEATURES
- added ghostbust and free slot menu options for modify-player
- added ability to select players or planets from player/planet list.
- added 'godsname' variable to configuration file and entry in options menu 
  to set something other then "GOD" when you send messages.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
- record files are not compatible across different servers if the struct.h's
  differ (i.e. record file from INL3.98 xsg will not work on xsg compiled for
  bronco-final).  The solution for now: recompile xsg with the struct.h used
  in the record file.  Eventually a struct.h-independent record file format
  should be developed.
- some servers occasionally construct a message over 80 chars which overwrites
  the 'm_from' field of that messages struct.  This was causing xsg to crash
  before; now increased checking avoids the crash and an error message is
  reported.  Thanks to Nick Trown for tracking this down.


v2.00
UPDATES/CHANGES by Tedd Hadley  (hadley@uci.edu)

BUGS FIXED
- removed accidental update of phaser/torp/cloak/explode fuses in 
  redraw.c'local().  Affect discovered at inl.ksu.edu, first diagnosed
  by Jimmy Huang.
- Xlib calls don't work from signal handlers.  New scheme sets a flag
  when the alarm clock goes off and draws.
- Program now shuts down when daemon exits and ignores gameup status.
  (The original scheme used status->gameup to cause xsg to shut down.
  Unfortunately, if gameup went to zero for some other reason (i.e. load
  average too high) you weren't able to use xsg.)

OPTIMIZATIONS
- Added several optimization features from the netrek client to make display
  smoother and reduce X packet overhead.
- Discovered that sprintf() was causing xsg to use much more cpu then would
  be expected.  Replaced it with byte-by-byte initialization scheme used in 
  netrek client.
- Changed record feature to store differences rather then complete state
  (See SHRINKFRAME in main.c). Produces 50% reduction in game file but 
  further shrinkage still possible.

FEATURES
- Added ability to display torps and phasers on the galactic map.  Torps
  show up as points, phasers same as before.  Slight smearing of planet
  names and army numbers a possibility.
- Added "Cool weapons" feature to ship modify menu.
- Added WT (weapon temperature) to player stats list.
- Changed tractor/pressor lines to be dotted and color coded (green: tractor,
  yellow: pressor) as in recent netrek clients.
- Changed display of cloaked players on galactic map from grey '??' to 
  '?<player number>' with appropriate team color.
- Added Bharat Mediratta's REPLAY v1.0 functionality to replay recorded
  games or game segments.
- Added Jimmy Huang's updates to xsg (based on the server-based game 
  recorder, also by Bharat Mediratta) to allow interactive game recording.
- Added MOO client clock (no, the clock doesn't reflect the time of a recording
  during playback .. yet).


UPDATES/CHANGES by Brian Paulsen (paulsb@fi.gs.com)

FEATURES
- added the ability to move players who are orbiting a planet
- hitting 'S' while locked on a player allows you to have status bars
  (like the client) that correspond to the player's damage/fuel/shields, etc.
- messages appear in the same color as the color of the team that wrote it
- planet army counts appear next to planet.
- hitting 'w' while locked on a player brings up a war window
  NOTE: there is a glitch - do not switch players while this war window
	is up.  It can be very confusing.  If you hit 'save changes' after
	switching players, it enforces the change onto the person you
	switched to, NOT the original person that you selected.
- hitting 'C' when in the message window allows you to counterfeit a
	message.  Type 'C', then type who the message should be from
	and then who you want it to go to.
- hitting 'R' brings up a robot entry menu - you can use this menu to
	make robots enter
  NOTE: Because of this change, make sure that you change the ROBOT
	declaration in defs.h to point to the right place!
  BUGS: I didn't want to figure out how to get the robots to not leave
	a defunct process lying around after they die.  When you exit
	xsg, the defunct processes will go away
	Also, you may have troubles with the robots depending on what
	system you run on.  Since I'm running on a Sun OS, I don't
	know what troubles you may or may not encounter if you are on
	something different.
