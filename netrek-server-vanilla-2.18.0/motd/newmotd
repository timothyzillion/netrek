Architecture:        HP 9000/730 running at 73 MIPS.
Internet Connection: T1
Server Type:         Bronco source with modifications for RSA and some
                     calvin stuff like displaying the sysdefs and logging
                     messages to god.

You can send messages to god! To do so send a message starting with
"GOD:". For example, "GOD: Hey are you listening!".

MODIFICATIONS:

2/19/93   Planets will not pop past 80.
2/19/93   Server will say why you died.
2/23/93   When out of tmode you can change sides.












What is Clue day?

    Basically there veteran players often like to have games without new
people that do not know how to play. To help in this fashion clue day is
now used on guzzler. The way it works is this:

1 On clue day the server will send you a message. 
2 You must send the message back the way it was sent in order to continue.
   If you don't you will be ejected from the game.


 What is Netrek?

 Netrek is a 16player graphical realtime battle simulation with a 
 Star Trek theme.  The game is divided into two teams of 8 (or less), who
 dogfight each other and attempt to conquer each other's planets.  There
 are several different types of ships, from fast, fragile scouts up to
 big, slow battleships; this allows a great deal of variance in play
 styles.


 Hints for Beginners:
    Watch your fuel.  When you run out, your weapons won't fire, you can't 
       go very fast to run away, and you'll be helpless.
    If you run out of fuel, go orbit a friendly or neutral fuel planet.  You
       can recognize these by the little fuel can looks kind of like a square
       on the right side of the planet, assuming your maps show resource 
        icons on the planets if not, see Getting Started, above.
    Avoid chasing ships, unless you know they are badly damaged or out of 
       fuel.  It's very hard for you to dodge their fire, and very easy for
       them to dodge yours.  On the other hand, if you can get someone to
       chase you, waste them!


 I would like to change what some of the keys do; for example, I'd
 like 't' instead of 'T' to activate my tractor beam.  Is there a way
 to change this?

 There are two ways: first, do a shiftO.  This brings up the options
 window.  Near the bottom there is a box for 'New keymap entries'.  
 Move your cursor to this box and type your new keymap entries.  The
 format is <newchar><oldchar>, so 'tT' will remap tractor beam to 't'.

 Netrek also recognizes a .xtrekrc file; a 'keymap:' line in there 
 will allow you to map as many as you want.  Format is the same
 as above.


 How does the rating/promotion system work?

 Do a shiftI on yourself; you'll see four ratings there, one for planets,
 one for bombing, one for offense, and one for defense.  The planet, 
 bombing, and offense ratings are measured in DI/hour; for each planet
 you take, army you bomb, and player you kill you get a certain amount
 of DI (which varies depending on the server)the average amount per
 hour is your rating.  Your defense rating is measured in relative
 life length: if your average life lasts exactly as long as the 
 overall average life, your defense rating will be 1.00.  If your average
 life lasts 80% as long as the overall average life, your defense rating
 will be .8.  All these ratings are updated only in tmode.

 Now do a shiftU.  Listed there are the thresholds for each rank.  
 Your overall rating is your planets+bombing+offense.  To make a rank,
 you need to have the DI required for that rank, and your ratings need
 to be above the rating required for that rank (i.e., to make Admiral,
 you need 320 DI and your ratings need to be above 8.0).  You can also
 make a ranking by having ratings good enough for a level and twice
 the DI you would need for the next level (So you can make Admiral 
 with ratings of 7.0 and 640 DI).  This equation also works for four times the
 DI, so you can also make it with 6.0 ratings and 1280 DI (which would take 
 about 200 hours!).

 On some servers, your defense also needs to be above .8 to advance
 past Lt. Commander.


 I keep dying.  How can I get better at the game?

 The best way is probably to talk with someone who knows how to play.
 There is also an archive of hints and suggestions on how to play 
 better; read the Netrek Server/FTP list to find out where it is
 located.


 What is 'tmode'?

 Tmode is short for 'tournament mode.'  To keep some integrity in the
 database, ratings are calculated only when there are a certain number
 of people in the game (actually, when there are a certain number of
 people on two separate teams.  On many servers, you need 4 players
 on 2 different teams; 4 teams of 2 players won't do it).  When 
 the game goes into tmode, there will be a 't' flag in your list
 of flags, and there will be a message like "Dan Quayle declares self
 as Galactic Emperor and chaos breaks out!"  When the game drops out
 of tmode (because someone quit), the 't' flag will disappear and
 there'll be a "Dan Quayle is locked up and order returns to the galaxy"
 message.  

 It's generally considered rude to bomb or take planets out of tmode.
 Some servers punish people for trying.


 Getting Started:
     When you start playing Xtrek, it's probably best if you use the 'guest'
        login handle.
     When you first enter the Game, hit the keys 'B' and 'V' twice each.  
       This makes the planets resources show up on the tactical and
       Galactic Maps.
    If you are experiencing a lot of 'blink' uneven screen updates, try
       setting your updates/second to a lower value.  Do this in the options
       window 'O' to bring it up.  Click the mouse button on the updates
       number until you get the number you want.
    Declare peace with everyone except perhaps the current enemy race.
       This way you won't be attacked by neutral planets and robots!

    Set stay peaceful when reborn in the options window again.  This way
       you won't have to redo your war settings every time you get shot down.

 Comments on ship choice:

       ScoutsSC:  These are fast fragile little things.  Good if you want to
               fly around the galaxy at high speed and get shot down by
               the first big ship that gets near.  They are very good for 
               harassing.

       DestroyersDD:  these are similar to scouts but they are a little more
               tough and they have slightly more powerful weapons.  They
               are decent to fight in if you're good at dodging and keeping
               larger ships away.

       Assault ShipsAS: These ships are primarily useful in bombing and
               capturing planets something that beginners should do after
               mastering the basics.  One of their unique features is that
               they may carry 3 armies per kill their captain has.  Also, 
               they are very tough to kill because they can take so much hull
               damage.  You have to plug extra torps into them 'just to be 
               sure'.  They also can cloak fairly cheaply.

        CruiserCA:  The standard ship.  It combines a wide variety of
               features.  Making it a good allaround ship.  It is the default
               ship if you don't select one.

       BattleshipBB:   This ship is slow and hard to maneuver.  However, it
               has the most firepower of any normal ship.  It is also very 
               tough.  Since it can take a fair amount of damage while still
               dishing out a lot, it is very effective for offensive players.
               This ship or the Cruiser is recommended for inexperienced 
               players, since it need not worry so much about evasive 
               maneuvers when it is in combat.  Also, it usually lasts
               longer, both in damage and fuel.

       StarbaseSB: These are very powerful and hard to destroy.  New players
               cannot play these except on chaos night.   Because they
               are so powerful, new players should probably avoid getting
               in fights with one.  It takes several players working together
               to destroy one!
