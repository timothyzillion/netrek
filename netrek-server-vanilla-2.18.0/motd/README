   'make convert'

USE
   
   If the server is compiled with AUTOMOTD, the makemotd program is run
   automatically every 12 hours.  As the server administrator you only
   need to edit the *.MASTER files.  
   * motd_logo.MASTER you should probably change once to add your name and 
     optional logo.
   * motd_local.MASTER should be updated whenever you want to add a new entry 
     to the motd.
   * info.MASTER should be updated once in a while to make sure new servers
     and ftp sites are added.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS

   Certain characters in the 6x10 font actually display graphics characters.
   Since they are difficult to enter with a standard text editor, the 'convert'
   program is provided which translates special characters to the corresponding
   graphics character.  A description of the special characters follows.  
   Special characters can be escaped by preceeding with '\'.

    -           -- horizontal bar
    _           -- lower horizontal bar
    &           -- lowest horizontal bar
    *           -- higher horizontal bar
    =           -- highest horizontal bar
    |           -- vertical bar
    $           -- upper-left corner
    `           -- upper-right corner
    <           -- lower-left corner
    >           -- lower-right corner
    +           -- crossbar
    %           -- 'T' connection
    (           -- 'T' connection rotated left 45 degrees
    )           -- 'T' connection rotated right 45 degrees
    ^           -- 'T' connection upside-down
    ~           -- diamond
