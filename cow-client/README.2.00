2)  Cut and past changes to make COW work like it used to.
*****************************************************************

2.00 pl0

The dashboard .xtrekrc defaults handling changed.

The boolean

	newDashboard

option is now and int default and

	newdashboard2

default is obsolete now. So you should use now on of:

# Text dashboard
newDashboard: 0

# COW style dashboard
newDashboard: 1

# KRP style dashboard
newDashboard: 2

# LABs new dashboard
newDashboard: 3


*****************************************************************
3)  Cut and past changes to turn on *all* new features.
*****************************************************************

	# LABs new kewl dashboard
	newDashboard: 3

The .xtrekrc entry for the highlightFriendlyPhasers option is: 
        
	highlightFriendlyPhasers: on

What does it do?  If on, friendly phasers that hit turn white, just like your
own phaser did before.

Jon Ellis has made some patches which he describes as "what if you
wanted your little sister to play some netrek?".  In short, if you turn on this
option with the .xtrekrc option : 

	censorMessages: on

then a list of obscenities in messages are filtered out.  No change unless you
specifically turn it on.  


Color map option:

 [-n]   use nearest colors in shared colormap
 
I really hate the flicker caused by changing colormaps.  Especially when 
the colors cow wants are already allocated (ie, Waitqueue 5 at bigbang, 
time to kill time elsewhere).

This patch adds the '-n' option, to accept the nearest match color rather 
than allocate a whole new colormap.

newDashboard:	(integer 0-3) new dashboard 1 and 2, has sliding bars instead of
		numbers at the bottom of the screen, 3 uses triangle sliders,
		definately worth a look.
