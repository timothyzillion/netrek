.xtrekrc options to deal with them, and the clips from the documentation that

2)  Cut and past changes to make COW work like it used to.
*****************************************************************

2.02 pl2

Borgish features have been completley removed and are not able
to turn on.
 
2.00 pl0

The showPhaser default has been replaced by PhaserMsg which translates
in the following way:

Old showPhaser:
  0 = don't show
  1 = show on kill window
  2 = show on phaser window
  3 = show on total review window only

New PhaserMsg:
  0 = Don't log phaser hits
  1 = Log phasers on all window
  2 = Log phasers on team window
  3 = Log phasers on indiv window
  4 = Log phasers on kill window
  5 = Log phasers on review window

If the phaser window is mapped it is logged there aditionally.

Message windows have now Scrollbars which are on per default.
You get the the old behaviour by turning it off:

	ScrollBar: off

5) Changes details
****************************************************************

Detailed changes by Michael Kellen:

  + Pitiful but legible greyscale pixmaps.  The greyscale maps should
    be used automatically on a Greyscale visual.  I have not checked
    to see if this actually works automagically.  It depends upon the
    value of W_Visual->class.   [nod to James Soutter for the idea]

  + FEATURE PACKET support for the agri-specific bitmaps.  If the server
    does not understand feature packets or sets AGRI_PIXMAP to false,
    the regular planet pixmap is used. [nod to rgn comments]

  + A colored circle can be drawn around the pixmap to indicate the 
    team which owns the planet.  [nod to someone ... I lost the letter]

  + On/Off controls for all pixmap stuff in both rcfile & options menu

  + Compatible with -n startup option

  + Compatible with private colormap

  + Turns off pixmaps and remembers to keep them off if they cannot be
    created for some reason  [nod to PictureMeNaked on the crappy Xterm]

  - Artwork still sucks. [raspberry to me]
