What the heck is this spike directory?

I started to use Extreme Programming (XP) <http://www.extremeprogramming.org>
on my last development project and was really impressed with it.

It impressed me so much, I mandated it for all development projects at Real 
Time. 

In getting cow to use SDL sound (SDL_mixer) I used XP principles, a Spike
Solution is one such principle.

You create a spike solution to reduce risk 
<http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html>.

Since I have never done any programming for sound, SDL, SDL_mixer, and cow 
itself. Ripping out the existing sound system was pretty risky (to me).

So I created a spike solution to learn about SDL, cow, sound, and how it all
could work together.

As I move forward I'll be adding more to the spike area.

My first spike solution was sdlwave. I just wanted to see some code and write
some code to play some sort of sound on RedHat Intel 6.2/7.2/7.3 with GNOME 
or KDE.

My second spike solution was cow-test. I wanted to see how SDL_mixer would play
the cow sounds.

The cow-test spike is the code that non-redhat users should compile and test to
see if it works.

See each sub-directory's README for details about that particular spike 
solution.
