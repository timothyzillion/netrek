Simple program to test if SDL_mixer can play the exiting 8bit PCM wave files.
The interface is pretty simple. I just load up 17 of the cow sounds and present
the user with the ability to under 0 to 16. The sound represented by that 
number will be played.

Users should test that multiple sounds can be played. A good test is to play 
the intro.wav (16) and then try some of the other sounds.

Control-c to exit.


Building cow-test, you'll need to have the following installed. I do -not-
check for it.

SDL-1.2.4
SDL-devel-1.2.4
SDL_mixer-1.2.4
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.4
