Mon May 22 23:06:52 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* x11window.c: add video mode change support, switches to 1024x768
	if it is available, and switches back to previous mode on exit.

	* system.mk.in: add libXxf86vm.
	
Mon May 22 22:59:54 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* x11window.c, x11window.h: fix all compilation warnings.

	* defaults.h, smessage.h, defaults.h, x11sprite.h: add prototypes.

	* camera.c, camera.h: add frame counter and per frame file names,
	defer imlib2 initialisation to first use in an attempt to find
	segfaults.
	
	* input.c, playback.c: during playback, 's' toggles per frame
	camera snapshots.  During game, 'C' takes a snapshot.

Mon May 22 22:59:06 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>
	
	* ping.c, short.c, socket.c: initialise some more packet buffers
	before sending, to fix valgrind reports.

Mon May 22 22:59:06 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* data.c: change default to LABs dashboard, while it isn't well
	liked by the experienced players it is well liked by newbies, and
	it's newbies who count.

	* playerlist.c: change default to sorted player list.  Same
	reasoning as above.

Mon May 22 22:58:43 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* configure.in: enable XPM in build.

Sat May 20 19:22:35 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* cowmain.c, feature.c, socket.c, ping.c, short.c: fix some
	valgrind reports of use of uninitialised data, possible sources of
	random information leakage in packets sent to server in situations
	where auto (stack) variables for packets may not be initialised.

Sat May 20 18:10:01 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* inform.c (inform): add PLCORE.
	* planetlist.c (planetlist): add PLCORE.

Fri Apr 14 20:33:28 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c (parseInput): fix format string for sscanf, more
	conversion specifiers were present than pointer arguments,
	suggesting that the code was trying to check for non-numeric in
	place of last specifier.  Reported by: Stephen Thorne.
	
Fri Apr 14 20:26:45 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c (version_r): fix growth of server list.
	Reported by: Stephen Thorne.

Wed Mar  1 18:08:33 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* netrek-client-cow-3.2.0: released.

Tue Feb 28 12:44:24 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* manifest: add files since last release sufficient to enable
	build, and remove non-source file win32/libgmp.a.

Tue Feb 28 12:44:10 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* Makefile (dist): change source package name to netrek-client-cow.

Thu Feb 23 15:55:29 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* dmessage.c, version.h, mkcflags.c, name.c: change version number
	format to x.y.z.

Thu Feb 23 09:40:58 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c (ReadMetasSend): fix regression caused by previous
	change, resulting in bad file descriptor errors from select in
	ReadMetasRecv().

2006-02-01  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* debian/changelog, debian/find-key.sh, debian/rules: 
	- At compile time figure out what RSA key to build againts. 
	- Created find-key.sh

2006-01-31  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* debian/control, debian/rules:
	- Missed the libxt-dev Build-Depdends (pbuilder rules)
	- For some reason configure cannot find the X11 headers, so added 
	  the location into the configure invocation

	* debian/control, debian/rules: 
	- Missed gmp develop package
	- Little documentation in debian/rules about key.def

	* Makefile:
	- Couple GNU make specific changes to make building no dep targets 
	  build by default. At least I believe the "::" does that under GNU 
	  make.

	* system.mk.in:
	- cow's Makefile is pretty convoluted and under normal(?) 
	  circumstances requires 2 builds. At least under debian. Change the 
	  depends to make a 1 time build possible which makes using pbuilder 
	  easier :-)

	* .cvsignore: 
	- Ignore some of the files that cdbs creates.

	* CVSROOT/loginfo:
	- Added netrek-dev@us.netrek.org too, since commits are very low 
	  volume lately.:-P

	* debian/README.Debian, debian/changelog, debian/control, debian/dirs, 
	  debian/netrek-client-cow.copyright, debian/netrek-client-cow.docs, 
	  debian/netrek-client-cow.examples, debian/netrek-client-cow.install, 
	  debian/netrek-client-cow.man, debian/netrek-client-cow.manpages, 
	  debian/rules, debian/source.lintian-overrides, debian/watch:
	- First commit for debian sid package. NOTE: Only worked the .deb on 
	  sid, once a few people QA build it (James?) on sid and we share out 
	  any lintian/linda issues, I'll build it for etch and sarge.

	* CVSROOT/loginfo: 
	- Found the problems(!) First, syncmail was way out of date, I snarfed 
	  the recommended version and installed it into CVSROOT, of course the 
	  commit of that change failed to send an email notification 
	  (chick-n-egg problem)
	- Next, cvs commit to cow are failing because there is no longer a
	  netrek-cow-cvs mailing list.
	- Upgraded syncmail to recommend revision from sourceforge's sitedocs.

Fri Jan 27 20:47:54 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c: fix overloaded definition of global sock.

Mon Jan  2 17:19:26 2006  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c: add multicast server packets for discovering
	servers on a local area network.

Fri Sep 30 21:33:15 2005  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* config.h.in: remove server defines.

	* configure.in: default configure script to --enable-unstable,
	since this is the version that most people are playing with, if
	they are playing a COW on UNIX at all.  Remove server code base
	specific stuff.  Add key file option --with-key.

Mon Jul  8 01:29:36 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* cow.desktop: Change Name to something more descriptive.

Tue Jun 25 10:28:46 2002  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* socket.c: remove unused strcpy_return(), and tidy PACKET_LOG
	code.

	* socket.c (print_packet): add packet logging that logs packets to
	stderr rather than just count them.  Was very useful in
	determining cause of update bug.  Not intended for 3.01pl0.
	From: Carlos Villalpando.

Sat Jun 22 14:30:42 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* sound.c: Fixed a small, if sound is off in the .netrekrc, SDL
	sound still tried to play the .wav files. Forgot to initialize the
	sound_init var.

Sat Jun 22 00:36:05 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* configure.in: Added check for sdl_config, don't find it, don't
	look for the SDL_mixer library.

Fri Jun 21 22:41:15 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* newwin.c (newwin): Added code to just popup window saying SDL
	sound is an all or nothing option.

	* findslot.c (findslot):  #ifdef'd out Exit_Sound()

	* cowmain.c: #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with
	SDL. #ifdef'd out Exit_Sound()

	* playback.c:  #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with SDL

	* local.c: #ifdef'd out Abort_Sound(), it's not need with SDL

	* sound.c: Removed the ability to toggle sounds under SDL. It's an
	all or nothing thing now. If request, I'll make SDL work with
	Kurt's sound toggling code.

Fri Jun 21 02:40:55 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* socket.c (doRead): An attempt to fix the full update bug
	(where's the bugzilla tracking number!) by reading 1024 bytes
	(BUFSIZE) for the socket instead of 768 bytes.

Fri Jun 21 00:43:53 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>
	* cow.spec: rolled new RPM from HEAD of cow tree

Thu Jun 16 02:31:27 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>
	* cow.spec: added cow.png and cow.desktop

Thu Jun 13 21:39:27 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* Makefile (profile): Added 'make profile' to generate a netrek
	binary to we can compare cow with SDL_mixer vs cow with the old
	sound code.

Wed Jun 12 22:52:13 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* playback.c (pbmain):  Converted enter_ship.wav

	* input.c (Key113): Converted self_destruct.wav

	* input.c (Key109): Converted message.wav

	* local.c (DrawMisc): Converted warning.wav

	* local.c (DrawPlasmaTorps): Converted plasma_hit.wav

	* local.c (DrawTorps): Converted torp_hit.wav

	* sound.h: added EXPLOSION_OTHER_WAV, PHASER_OTHER_WAV,
	FIRE_TORP_OTHER. and the code to load these new sounds.

	* local.c (DrawShips): Converted cloak.wav, uncloak.wav,
	shield_down.wav, shield_up.wav, explosion.wav,
	explosion_other.wav, phaser.wav, phaser_other.wav

	* cowmain.c (cowmain): Converted enter_ship.wav and engine.wav

	* sound.c: added isDirectory to check that the sounddir is
	actually a directory.

Tue Jun 11 01:10:51 2002  Bob Tanner  <tanner@real-time.com>

	* system.mk.in: Added SDL_CFLAGS, SDL_CONFIG, SDL_LIBS,
	SDL_MIXER_LIBS

	* sound.c: Added HAVE_SDL wrapper, initialization of SDL system,
	opening of audio device, and loading of 17 cow sounds.
	
	* cowmain.c (cowmain): HAVE_SDL wrapper to Init_Sound using SDL. I
	moved the Init_Sound method to right after readdefaults() so the
	intro can start playing ASAP.

	* configure.in: Added AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM, added check for SDL, 
	add check for SDL_mixer.

	* config.h.in: add HAVE_SDL

	* spike: See spike/README for details

Thu May 23 13:03:22 2002  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* data.h (PL_OFF): add constant for playback disabled.

Tue May  7 09:15:16 2002  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* configure.in: --enable-unstable bug fix.
	From tanner@real-time.com

Tue Jul 24 14:47:50 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* parsemeta.c: fix delay during UDP startup, by waiting up four
	seconds for the first response from a metaserver, and not waiting
	one second between processing X events on the window.Update the
	list properly on a refresh.  Fix empty window when the player is
	serviced by satellite delays.

	Change the colour on a server line to Cyan during a connection
	attempt to observe, and to Yellow during a normal connection
	attempt.  Change to Green on successful connection.  Change to Red
	if connection fails.
	
	Make better guesses as to the initial size of the window.  Tidy up
	messages, remove excess periods, and add warning about no return
	packets suggesting a firewall as the cause.
	
Tue Jun 12 16:32:48 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* playback.c (pbmain): process all windowing events before
	proceeding to the next update, rather than just the one event.
	With pixmaps enabled on a playback, the event queue would grow
	causing the keystrokes to be ignored for many seconds.  Enabling
	pixmaps generates more events.

Tue Jun 12 12:03:42 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* playback.c, input.c: add single-step playback keys, enter to
	step forward, backspace to step backward, and space to stop and
	start.

	Implemented as a flag (pb_stepping) that is non-zero when a step
	is in progress.  Once the next frame has been displayed, the flag
	is cleared and the playback pauses.  Required a minor change to
	input.c to catch keys that would otherwise be rejected because
	they were control characters.

Fri Apr 27 21:46:13 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* socket.c: when RSA is not defined, a warning is generated for
	the prototype of handleRSAKey because it references a struct
	rsa_key_spacket which is not defined.  Moved the prototype into
	the #ifdef RSA.

	* socket.c: minor warning from casting in connect call.

	* input.c (initkeymap): getctrlkey() was being passed a "char *"
	instead of "unsigned char *".

	* main.c: include "defs.h" for getdefault() prototype.

	* docwin.c (loadxtrekrc): remove minor compiler warning.
	
	* config.h.in: remove superfluous definition of SIGSYS on Linux.

	* Makefile (distclean): add distclean target to comply with GNU
	package conventions.

	* configure.in: change testing of BSD signals in configure to
	shows an answer cache it.  From code contributed to Vanilla by
	Benjamin `Quisar' Lerman <quisar@quisar.ambre.net>

	* helpwin.c (help_message): rethink each help message, remove the
	word toggle and replace with on/off, as toggle is a technical
	term, remove mixed case descriptions in favour of lower case, move
	some verbs to the end of the message, and change the column fit
	algorithm to avoid overflow in normal and 800x600 mode.

	* input.c (keyaction): redirect keystrokes that would otherwise be
	ignored to be processed in the tactical window.  Novice users find
	it painful to have to put the cursor unnecessarily into the
	tactical window before pressing a key.

	* getname.c (handleWEvents): accept keystrokes from any netrek
	window during login, and refresh the development team text on the
	login window as soon as a redraw is required rather than waiting
	for the next second.

	* getname.c (loaddude): if server rejects guest login, allow the
	user to retry with a real name.  Current INL servers are coded to
	reject guest login.  Having to restart the client is unnecessary.

Fri Apr 27 11:34:50 2001  Benjamin `Quisar' Lerman  <quisar@quisar.ambre.net>

	* cowapi.h, data.c, data.h, defaults.c, main.c, socket.c: change
	-U to also adopt a local port number for TCP mode.
	
Thu Apr 26 15:52:16 2001  James Cameron  <quozl@us.netrek.org>

	* Makefile (dist): change dist and distdoc targets to generate a
	.tar.gz file that unpacks to a directory below the current
	directory.  Note: also writes the output kit file to the current
	directory rather than the directory above.

	* INSTALL: new file, standard generic installation instructions.

	* README: new file, explains the other important package
	documentation files.

	* ChangeLog: new file, a programmers change log as per GNU
	packaging standards and automated EMACS change log entry creation.

	* .cvsignore: add list of files to be ignored by CVS.
