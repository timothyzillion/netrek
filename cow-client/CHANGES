-dashboard.c - fix kills now being shown - nelson
-fix duplicate Conquer file if message logging on
-add .xtrekrc option: reportKills: on/off (do you want kills in review window?)

pl15
- playerlist displays dead players - nelson (playerlist.c)
- removed old unused makefiles from manifest
- jeffw patches to make it more x11 friendly
- and makefile cleanup (again- sigh)
- sls@aero.org:
1. Add W_{Get,Set}Window{Button,KeyDown,KeyUp,Expose}Handler functions
to Wlib.h

2. Implement those functions in x11window.c

3. Modify input.c (and some others) to use those functions.  This avoids
a lot of ugly code in input() (it's possibly it's faster as well, dunno.)

4. Get rid of the polling stuff in getname

5. Eliminate an unneccessary call to time() in run_clock.

- SMARTMACRO %% fix - nelson@soliton.physics.arizona.edu
- galactic updates when you're on re-entry screen - jmn
- hello screen tries to credit all big contributors (I bet I missed some) - jmn
- warning.c: nelson@soliton.physics.arizona.edu
    Here is a quick warning.c patch which does two things,
1)  fixes a bug in the size of the phaser message (+10 -> +9)
2)  if logmessages is active, dumps phaser warnings
- x11window.c: jeffw@cs.tamu.edu
This will cause the window manager to place any top level
window anywhere it wants, but is overridden if the
geometry is specified in the defaults file.
- x11window.c: Kurt.Siegl@risc.uni-linz.ac.at
I had some time to fix the 4 plane bug again. But there are still
plenty of other bugs which I didn't correct yet.

- solaris patches - jeffw
- autologin added - Robert Kenney
        0)  Autologin is only enabled if a default password is given, either
            on the command line via '-A', or with a "password:" in the .rc.

        1)  If the playername has never been used, the autologin procedure
            will create it with the given password.

        2)  If the password fails for the given player name, then an
            error message is displayed, and the user is dropped back into
            the manual login mode, and prompted for a correct playername/
            password.

        3)  If everything matches, the first thing you should see is the
            team selection phase.

- MDISTR flagging confuses servers.. (messages to TEAM with MDISTR don't 
  get transmitted).. I'll wait till heiko finishes his SHORT message protocol
  for this
- messages marked with MCONQ get put on stdout in addition to message window


pl3- hadley,John Sin, jmn
- added defines _IBMR2  for IBM RS6000 AIX3.2 support
- fixed ping calculations overflow problem
- boolean was a dumb variable name- changed wherever dec cc used to barf on it
- handlePlasmaxxx CORRUPTED_PACKETS ntohs problem fixed 


pl2 April 23 93 - rick, sam , jmn
- added ck_players code to client - rick
- added mega paranoid rsa-client.c generator thanks to sam shen 
  this means berk+ricksmoo is most secure client out there right now 
- moved xtrePort related code in main.c to top of main.c 
  this fixes ck_players code if you give no port
- ROMVLUS (gross- jmn) CA bitmap apparantly added (default is OFF)- rick
  either use options or use .xtrekrc line: ROMVLVS: on/off
- the ROMVLVS bitmaps are buggy right now (when going up they don't draw 
  at all- jmn)- was an optimizer bug of mine


pl1 April 20 93 - jmn
- compiled with new berk+ricksmoo dec key (nick - our key god has this one)
- added Key_Version to version.h
- fixed makefile library ordering for RSA - didn't work previously
- leonard's fix to getcourse in input.c applied
- cleaned up RSA related dependencies in makefile


1.00pl0 Apr 19 93 - jmn
- added observer support (your ship isn't displayed if you are on another one)
- merged nick trown's variable distress call code (-DNBTDIST, -DNBTDISTVAR) 
  and macro code (-DNBT) 
- pigcall changed to something appropriate
- added -v flag to get version info
- cleaned up makefile
- added version, patchlevel and cflags files


macros:
macro.x.X:      <text here>
#x is any ascii character; it is the "name" of the macro (the key you press
#in macro mode to send the associated macro)
#X can be A,T,F,R,K,O where A=all, T=team, F=fed, R=rom, K=kli, O=ori
#(determines the message board to which the text body of the macro is sent)
Example: 
macro.b.T:              BOMB!!!!

#Variable distresses (only available if -DNBTDISTVAR)
#I'm not sure letting people play with these is a good idea....
#variable distress calls- ala nick trown
# custom distress calls. d. is for ships. d.sb. is for SBs.
# the different levels for changes in the distress calls.
# first number is low value. Second is high value. In between is mid.
# set up strings for each part of the distress call.
# a '_' is a "no show"

d.shld.lvl:             10 90
d.shld.low:             SHLDS OUT!
d.shld.high:            _
d.shld.mid:             %d%% shlds

d.dam.lvl:              10 90
d.dam.low:              _
d.dam.high:             %d%% DAM!
d.dam.mid:              %d%% dam

d.arms.lvl:             0 50
d.arms.low:             _
d.arms.high:            _
d.arms.mid:             %d Armies

d.fuel.lvl:             10 90
d.fuel.low:             FUEL OUT!
d.fuel.high:            _
d.fuel.mid:             %d%%fuel

# starbase stuff.... Much more interesting than ship distress I reckon
d.sb.dam.lvl:           10 66
d.sb.dam.low:           _
d.sb.dam.mid:           %d%% dam

Recent updates to the "moo" client. 
(sort of a tribute to harvard Admiral Moooooooo!) (aka ryche)

future changes i'm working on:
    having the outgoing message you are composing to redraw.
    Configurable bitmaps for your cursors and your women,
    if you happen to be sick enough not to like Kathy and Steph.
--> RSA soon to be added by bronco gods.

i'm open to suggestions...

Changes to 'original' Mehlhaff client as of Apr 17, 1993:

BRAND NEW FEATURES!!--

o enemy phasers are now dotted lines so people on color
  machines have less advantage over us b&w users.
o you can turn the babes off if you want. .netrekrc resource:
  babes: on/off
o In color, you can have your shield be color of your warning
  status, like your slot number.  resource:  
  warnshields:  on/off
o lagmeter now working.  \ to see the window and . to see the
  netstat window  resources:
  netstats:  on    netstatfreq:  5      (how many updates to
  the lagmeter per second)
o silly info-borg planet bitmaps are now optional.
  resource:   newPlanetBitmaps:  on/off 
o client now responds to pigcall with "ricksmoo ver. 1.08"
  will only respond to individual messages. not 5 spaces to ALL.
o added hadley's ping stuff. the "," key brings the window up.
o Windows can now be resized!!
o zorg type XSendEvents will not be accepted by moo.
o moo has no default server compiled in. you must use -h
  or the .netrekrc resource
o New Sexist Features:  Stephanie Seymour now welcomes you to MOO
  when you enter your name. Kathy Ireland informs you if you get
  ghostbusted.
o the 'you were killed by' messages now redraw.
  sometimes they change the names when they do... not sure why.
o Phaser hits can now be logged in different places.
  resource--  showPhaser:   2
  0 = don't show
  1 = show on kill window
  2 = show on phaser window
  3 = show on total review window only

  the phaser window is controlled just like the other
  review windows.  e.g.:
     review_phaser.mapped:   on
     review_phaser.parent:   netrek
     review_phaser.geometry: 81x2+0+555
o Changed the 'you were killed by' messages to be more 
  degrading. (You were SMACKed by a plasma from R3)
o client now tells you what server you have connected 
  to in the name entry screen, also in the wait queue
o added kill messages to the message logging feature.
o you can change the defaults file you want to read in
  by sending the name of the file to 'M' (you->MOO)
  currently, you have to put the full path to the file in
  but I'll see about ~ completion...
      example:  F0->MOO  /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/cm5m/.netrekrc
                then hit & to re read the defaults.
o defaults file can now be re-read in. using the & key.
  this way you can change defaults without quitting out.
   Currently the only changes that will take effect are
   the message macros and the keymap.
o Configurable message macros to the all board. control-jkliop
  send to ALL board messages from your .xtrekrc
  resource--   message1: your control-j message
               message2: your control-k message
               message3: your control-l message
               message4: your control-i message
               message5: your control-o message
               message6: your control-p message
o Made the regular info window smaller. the shift-i info window
  is bigger. It contains the deleted info from the regular one.
o Made the time-out for entering your name 199 seconds.
  Used to be 99.
o Client now calls you by your real rank, not just "Captain!"
o added message logging on/off by default file.
  resource--   logging: on
o Added time stamping to logged messages.
o Added message logging. Will log TEAM and ALL board messages,
  either to standard out (your xterm, whatever) or, to a file.
  usage:  moo -l /path/to/messagelog OR in .xtrekrc- logfile: file
  the message logging is toggled with the ':' key.
o Player list sorting is now toggleable with the '/' key, which
  you can remap like any normal key.
o show shields/don't show shields removed from shift-O window.
  if this bothers you, see a pshychiatrist
o show stats/don't show stats removed from shift-O window.
  if this bothers you, use shift-S. that's what it's for.
o Removed 'M' key. If this bothers you, see a doctor.
  ('M' key used to turn off the galactic map)
o Show resources on galactic map by default.
o Update galactic map frequently by default.
o Visible tractor/pressors turn off when tractee cloaks.
o Show My Speed is no longer an option.
o bug in x11window.c fixed.
o beeps twice when you make the queue.
o Small clock is displayed on the far right of tstat window.
o Distress calls show armies carried as last field. (easier to read)
o SB distress call says "HELP!!" (to attract more attention)
o New (better?) cursor for tactical & galactic.
o Option to not continue the visible tractors. (a la Bert's client)

Can write TEAM and ALL messages to a file when you hit ':'
resource--  logfile:	/tmp/messagelog
the logfile can also be given on the command line.

Can show nothing, resources, or owner on galactic by default.
resource--  showgalactic:    1
2 = nothing
1 = resources
0 = ownership

Can show nothing, resources, or owner on local map by default.
resource--  showlocal:    2
2 = nothing
1 = resources
0 = ownership

Can turn off planet names by default.
resource-- showplanetnames:   off

Can sort player list by team. code fixed by Greg. (gc2n@andrew.cmu.edu)
resource-- sortPlayerlist:   on

Can show lock on galactic, local, galactic & local, or none.
resource-- showLock:  3
0 = none
1 = galactic
2 = local
3 = both

Can be set to not continue the visible tractors.
resource-- continuetractor:	on
on = continue
off = turns off after 2 updates.

---- OLD README, from Mehlhaff client ---
New key commands:
    >  increase speed by 1
    <  decrease speed by 1
    }  turn on cloaking device.
    {  turn off cloaking device.

    F  send a report of armies carried. This sends a message to your team
       saying how many armies you are carrying.  Many players used to use
       distress signals to quickly convey the same information, lessening
       the impact of the distress signal.  Distress signals should be for
       emergencies, not just common usage.

Changed distress signals:
	The distress signal of ships tells your team if you are low on fuel.
    Many ships are just as doomed when out of fuel as they are when they are 
    damaged.  
	Alternately, if you are flying a starbase, the distress signal 
    tells instead how your weapon temperature is doing, because starbases
    overheat far more often than they run out of fuel.
    Also, after the percentage weapon temperature, it will put a 'W' if 
    your weapons are currently overheated.


Help Window:  
	Basically, this was done to show what keys were
    actually mapped to what functions.  Every key function has a line in 
    the help window. Her'es a sample line:

    s gb  Toggle shields
    ||\\_ The 'b' key has been mapped to toggle shields
    || \_ The 'g' key has also been mapped toggle to  the shields
    |\____This space is always there, as a separator.
    \_____This is the default key for this function, and the hook that you
	  use when defining things to this function. I.e. to set the 'g' 
	  and 'b' mappings mentioned here, you'd have to put 'gsbs' in 
	  your .xtrekrc or your keymap options.
	  NOTE:  This character will appear here, even if it is mapped
		to something else.

Featues from the Calvin_bwo client, by Tedd Hadley:
    These features had been available in the hadley client for quite some
    time.  If they bother you, you should bother him.

Lock-on Icon:
	A little triangle is put above the icon of planet that you are 
    locked onto.  If you are locked onto a ship, this icon goes on the
    bottom.

Message-Warp:  The non-warp version.
   	Hit the 'm' key and start typing. Your cursor changes to the
    'text' cursor, and all keystrokes go to the message window.  Sending
    the mesage or the ESC key ends this.  Note, the mouse pointer is not moved, 
    and in fact, you could even still shoot and/or steer with mouse
    events while in 'message' state.

Changed cursors:
	The cursor changes in different windows. Of specific importance
    is the tactical cursor and how it changes when non-warp message-warp.
    Is activated.
   
New xtrekrc features:
	A sample xtrekrc should come with the client, but here are some of the
    new xtrekrc options:

    buttonmap:  map the mouse buttons to something else.
	i.e. the default mapping is:
	  1t2p3k

    server: default server that is called when no -h argument is
	specified.  The compiled in default server is bronco.ece.cmu.edu
    port:   default port that gets called. The compiled default is 2592

    showtractorpressor:  toggle showing tractor/pressor  beams

       UDp control
    tryUdp:	(on/off) Automaticaly use UDP if on
    udpDebug:
    udpClientSend:
    udpClientRecv:
    udpSequenceChk:

    extraAlertBorder:  Draws border in internal netrek windows, as well
	as external ones (which get ignored in X11 with window-managers )

    forcemono:	   if on, the client windows are set to be monochrome
